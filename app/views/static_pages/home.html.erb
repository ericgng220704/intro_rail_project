    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <li>"species-list?key=[YOUR-API-KEY]" : to retrieve list of plants </li>
      <li>"species/details/[ID]?key=[YOUR-API-KEY]" : to retrieve detail of a plant</li>
      <li>"pest-disease-list?key=[YOUR-API-KEY]" : to retrieve list of plant diseases </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8">Database Structure</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
